# acados benchmark
This repo contains my experiments with singularity free NMPC, as introduced in 
the publication: *NMPC for Racing Using a Singularity-Free Path-Parametric Model
 with Obstacle Avoidance - Daniel Kloeser, Tobias Schoels, Tommaso Sartor, Andrea Zanelli, Gianluca Frison, Moritz Diehl. Proceedings of the 21th IFAC World Congress, Berlin, Germany - July 2020*. 

This was used to benchmark acados on different machines using a relatively involved 
OCP formulation.
